## Project

This is a open source sentient, general purpose AI.

## Business Model

The business model provides support for companies who want to use the software on a large scale. Additionally, a paid cloud service that runs the AI on a super computer allows for users to make more demanding requests.

## License

This project uses the GPL license because it allows for users to modify the code but the modifications must be open source. This allows us to monitor all changes made to the code and integrate any features we like.
